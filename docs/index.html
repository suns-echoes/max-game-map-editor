					One day, a new M.A.X. Commander was assigned to explore
					distant star systems to find new habitable worlds.
					The worlds that no one had seen but many dreamed about.
					The Commander decided to utilize all means necessary
					to complete the task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, careful planning and gathering all available data
					about the known universe led to only one conclusion:
					it is very doubtful to find new compatible worlds using
					conventional methods. Determined, the Commander devised
					the ultimate plan.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan was to create a highly sophisticated "utility"
					capable of distorting the fabric of space and time,
					which would then be used to develop new habitable planets.
