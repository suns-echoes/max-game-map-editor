## ▰ Introduction

Welcome back M.A.X. Commanders!

I present the announcement of M.A.X. Map Editor – the ultimate open-source tool
for crafting custom maps for the classic M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault & Exploration.

I started this project to fulfill our all-long dreams of assault and exploration
of an unlimited number of new planets and regions where we could try new tactics
and enjoy exploration like it was the first time.

The main goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and enjoyable mapping
experience for all M.A.X. enthusiasts.

### ▰ Planned Features:

Here’s a sneak peek at some of the features planned for the M.A.X. Map Editor:

- modern and intuitive GUI with quick access to all essential features;
- fluid map zoom and panning with minimap for easy navigation and quick focus on
  specific areas of your map;
- toggleable real-time tiles animation;
- tools for easy and efficient map designing:
    - auto-shore feature,
    - semi-random fill (water, ground, obstacles),
    - terrain templates - no more headaches when drawing mountains!
    - adjacent tile suggestions to boost the design process;
- random map generator with customizable parameters:
    - seed-based generator for easy sharing of awesome maps,
    - the adjustable amount and distribution of water (open ocean, sea, lakes and rivers),

- support for custom tile sets and palettes;
- palette editor for tweaking colors;
- palette hot swap for fast choosing the best one;

... only time will tell what other features might be.

## ▰ Preparing development environment

### ▰ Setting up IDE

#### ----▰ VSCode

To prevent collision with Vite CSS processing mechanism files containing
web components styles have the `.style` extension. To allow IDE
to understand what they are, do the following:

1. Open `Settings` by pressing `Ctrl + ,`;
2. Find `files associations`;
3. Add new entry item `*.style` with `css` value.
